# promptr
a simple image generation tag-based prompt builder

This was a simple tag based prompt builder I made as a proof of concept for another project. 

I've put it here in case anyone finds it useful. I probably wont update it much but if there's any bugs let me know and I can take a look.

Its pretty simple but I never got around to creating the actual templates. They are easy to make though and can save a lot of time when generating prompts.
